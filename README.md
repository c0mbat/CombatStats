- 16/07/2020
  - Bot now says ";commands for help" in the member list.
  - Regional ranks are no longer supported by the game. They have been removed from the bot and replaced with...
  - ... a new operator stats commands. Adding an operator as an argument after your username will pull up some statistics.
